# 📚 Wikipedia Usage Probability Analysis 📚

## Overview
Welcome to the **Wikipedia Usage Probability Analysis** project! Have you ever wondered how likely students are to use Wikipedia? In this project, we explore the probabilities surrounding Wikipedia usage among a sample of students using the **binomial distribution**. We analyze key random variables such as:
- 📈 The **Probability** of using Wikipedia
- 🎯 The **Expected Number** of users
- ➕ The **Cumulative Probability** for specific usage scenarios

This project utilizes **R programming** to analyze and visualize the distribution, providing fascinating insights into student behavior.

## 🔍 Key Features
- 🚀 **Binomial Distribution Analysis**: Calculate probabilities for various scenarios (e.g., at least 15 students using Wikipedia).
- 📊 **Statistical Insights**: Determine mean, variance, and standard deviation for a deeper understanding of the data.
- 🎨 **Visualizations**: Create colorful plots of the **Probability Mass Function (PMF)** to illustrate the distribution clearly.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/wikipedia-usage-analysis.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have **R** installed. You can download it [here](https://www.r-project.org/).
3. Install the required R packages:
   ```r
   install.packages("ggplot2")
   install.packages("dplyr")
   ```

### Usage
1. Open the `wikipedia_usage_analysis.Rmd` file in RStudio or any R environment.
2. Run the script to compute probabilities and generate PMF plots for Wikipedia usage among students.

Witness the statistical magic as the script reveals insights into student engagement with Wikipedia!

## 📊 Example Output
- **Probability Calculations**: Probabilities for various usage scenarios, including $X > 11$ and $X \geq 15$.
- **PMF Visualizations**: Graphs showcasing the probability distribution with highlighted ranges for clarity.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **R programming**: For statistical computations and analysis of probabilities.
- **ggplot2**: A powerful package for data visualization in R.
- **dplyr**: A robust package for data manipulation in R.
